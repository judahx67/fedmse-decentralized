Implementation Plan for Decentralized Federated Learning System

1. Code Restructuring and Decentralization
   - Move model aggregation logic from global to client classes (named global_aggregator.py and client_trainer.py)
   - Create/update client class to include aggregation functionality
   - Modify main.py to:
     * Remove global aggregation code
     * Call client-based aggregation methods
     * Select appropriate client for aggregation based on voting mechanism

2. Weight Calculation and Voting System
   - Implement MSE-based weight calculation system
   - Add voting mechanism where:
     * Each client calculates its MSE score
     * Weights are assigned based on MSE performance
     * Clients vote for aggregator selection
   - Ensure weight calculation is transparent and fair
DONE 

3. Security and Anti-Manipulation Measures
   - Implement rotation system for aggregator selection
   - Add tracking mechanism to monitor aggregator selection frequency
   - Set maximum threshold for how often a client can be selected as aggregator


4. Implementation Steps
   a. Code Migration Phase
      - Move aggregation code to client class
      - Update client class structure
      - Modify main.py to use new client-based aggregation
   
   b. Voting System Implementation
      - Add MSE calculation functionality
      - Implement weight assignment system
      - Create voting mechanism
   
   c. Security Implementation
      - Add aggregator selection tracking
      - Implement rotation rules
      - Add safeguards against manipulation

5. Testing and Validation
   - Test aggregation functionality
   - Verify voting system fairness
   - Ensure security measures are effective
   - Validate overall system performance

Note: This implementation maintains the decentralized nature of the system while ensuring fair and secure model aggregation through a robust voting mechanism.
